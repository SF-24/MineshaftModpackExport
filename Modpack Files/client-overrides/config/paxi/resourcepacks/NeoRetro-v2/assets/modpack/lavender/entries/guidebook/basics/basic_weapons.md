To get stone tools and weapons, you must first mine gravel, which has a chance of dropping flint when mined.

The flint can then be used to craft stone tools on a workbench crafting grid.
These are more durable and stronger than wooden tools.

A stone pickaxe can then be used to mine cobblestone, which can also be used to create stone tools.
