The different topics of the modpack are categoriesed to make it easier to find what you're looking for.

Not all entries in this guidebook will initially be unlocked. More will become available as you progress.

In case you lose your guidebook, you may craft a new one using the following recipe:

<recipe;modpack:guidebook>

To begin, you may familiarise yourself with the overlay to the right of your inventory. This is used to view item recipes.

\
You can also hover over an item in your inventory and cick R to see its recipe and U to see its uses in crafting. 
It may be a good habit to view the uses of unfamiliar items you may come accross.

Next, it is advised you look at the category [getting started](^modpack:guidebook/getting_started) for more information.
