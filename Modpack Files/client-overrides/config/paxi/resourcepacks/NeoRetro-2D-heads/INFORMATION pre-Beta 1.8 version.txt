Old Sounds v1.19_5 (compatible with Minecraft versions 1.9+) by Sencie
https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/old-sounds-4911323/
‘pre-Beta 1.8’ version. The pack brings back the old sounds and removes many sounds to recreate the pre-Beta 1.8 atmosphere.
To preserve the consistency of the game experience, some new sounds are changed to old style.

This pack only changes the sounds. Please use it with the Programmer Art pack 
or another retro texture pack such as Developer Art Classic https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/devart-classic/
